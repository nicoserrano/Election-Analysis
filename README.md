# Election-Analysis
#### Audit on congressional election using Python 3


## Project Overview
This project will analyze the Colorado Congressional Election data to come up with a summary consisting of the total number of votes cast, each county's turnout, each candidate's vote count and percentage, and the results with the winner. 

## Resources
- Data source: election_results.csv
- Software: Python 3.6.1, Visual Studio Code 1.56.2

## Analysis
In order to come up with the analysis of the election data I utilized python packages such as csv and os; variables like integers, floats, lists, dictionaries; modules to modify and call objects; membership and logical operators; repetition statements like for loops; and different printing formats like f-strings. *The code will be attached to the repo like 'PyPoll_Challenge.py', if you want to take a look to the script*.

## Results
- There were 369,711 votes cast in the election.
- From all the votes, each county's turnout was as follows:
  - 38,855 votes came from Jefferson, which accounted for 10.5% of the election. 
  - 306,055 votes came from Denver, which accounted for 82.8% of the election.
  - 24,801 votes came from Anapahoe, which accounted for 6.7% of the election. 
- The county with the largest nuymber of votes was Denver.
- The congressional candidates were:
  - Charles Casper Stockham
  - Diana DeGette
  - Raymon Anthony Doane
- The candidate results were:
  - Charles C. Stockham received 23.0% of the vote and 85,213 number of votes.
  - Diana DeGette received 73.8% of the vote and 272,892 number of votes.
  - Raymon A. Doane received 3.1% of the vote and 11,606 number of votes.
- The winner of the election was Diana DeGette with 73.8% of the vote (272,892 votes).
